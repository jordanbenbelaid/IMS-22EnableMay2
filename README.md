## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
There were multiple types of software required to complete this project.
The list is as follows:
Software required to complete the project Kanban Board was Jira - Atlassian
GitHub had to be downloaded to push all data to local repository via newly created branches.
MySQL was downloaded to implement code for the project. This then had to be linked to Eclipse, an CLI used to develop Java database.
Maven installer had to be implemented within Eclipse (Java) also in order to connect and access databases for project.
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Here is a step by step guide to enable you to modify environemental variables for Java.

## Running the tests

On Eclipse, select the green 'run' arrow to run the program. Alternatively the buttons 'ctrl' and 'F11' will do run the tests.
Firstly, a database will appear, welcoming you to the database and giving you multiple options to choose from with simple one word commands.
'CUSTOMER', 'ITEM', 'ORDERS', 'ORDER_ITEMS' and 'STOP'
