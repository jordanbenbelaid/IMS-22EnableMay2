## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
There were multiple types of software required to complete this project.
The list is as follows:
Software required to complete the project Kanban Board was Jira - Atlassian
GitHub had to be downloaded to push all data to local repository via newly created branches.
MySQL was downloaded to implement code for the project. This then had to be linked to Eclipse, an CLI used to develop Java database.
Maven installer had to be implemented within Eclipse (Java) also in order to connect and access databases for project.
